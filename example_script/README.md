I've been working on wer-scraping with R for a while. I'm active on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6037369/yifu-yan) and answered a bunch of web-scraping questions regarding on rvest and Rselenium. You can check for [my answers](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6037369/yifu-yan?tab=answers) and see if any answers solved your problem. Also, this folder contains some web-scraping scripts I've used.
